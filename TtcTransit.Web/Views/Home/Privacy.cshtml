<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>
    This is a placeholder privacy page for the TtcTransit demo application.
</p>

<p>
    In the real system this page would describe how we handle data from:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>GTFS feeds (public transit data)</li>
    <li>API requests from devices (e.g. ESP32 controllers)</li>
    <li>Web visitors and logs</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For now it simply exists so that the navigation link in the layout does not return 404.
